OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a simple application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. BMI is a metric used to evaluate an individual's body weight relative to their height and is commonly used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight.

Features
User Input: The app should prompt users to enter their height and weight.
BMI Calculation: Compute BMI using the formula:
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
Category Display: Based on the BMI value, categorize the result into one of the standard BMI categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
Results Presentation: Display the calculated BMI and the corresponding category to the user.
Technical Requirements
Programming Language: The app can be developed in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, or Swift.
User Interface: A user-friendly interface is essential for ease of use. This could be a web application, mobile app, or a desktop application.
Validation: Ensure input values are valid (e.g., height and weight should be positive numbers).
Components
Frontend

Input Fields: Text fields for entering height and weight.
Submit Button: Button to trigger the calculation.
Results Display: Area to show the calculated BMI and its category.
Backend (Optional)

BMI Calculation Logic: Code to perform the BMI calculation and determine the category.
APIs: If the app is web-based or mobile-based, consider developing APIs to handle the calculation.
Validation

Input Validation: Ensure that height and weight are positive numbers and handle edge cases.
Error Handling

User Feedback: Provide appropriate messages for invalid inputs or calculation errors.
Implementation Steps
Design the User Interface

Sketch the layout of the input fields, buttons, and result display area.
Create wireframes or mockups if needed.
Set Up the Development Environment

Choose the development tools and environment based on the chosen platform (e.g., web, mobile, or desktop).
Develop the Frontend

Implement the input fields for height and weight.
Add a button to submit the data.
Display the result after calculation.
Implement the Backend Logic

Write the BMI calculation function.
Categorize the BMI value and return the result.
Testing

Test the app with various inputs to ensure accuracy and handle edge cases.
Perform usability testing to ensure the app is user-friendly.
Deployment

Deploy the app on a suitable platform (e.g., web server, app store).
Documentation and Support

Document the code and user instructions.
Provide support for potential issues or updates.
Example Technologies
Web Application: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, or Vue.js)
Mobile Application: Swift (iOS), Kotlin/Java (Android), Flutter
Desktop Application: Python (Tkinter), Java (Swing/JavaFX)
